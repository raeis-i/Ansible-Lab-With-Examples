# Ansible_Lab_With_Real_Examples
In the previous repository, we learned how to bring up an Ansible lab and run a simple ad-hoc command.

[Full-Automated-Ansible-Lab-with-Vagrant-Virtualbox](https://github.com/raeis-i/Full-Automated-Ansible-Lab-with-Vagrant-Virtualbox).

In this repository, we are going to use:

1- ["ansible.builtin.user"](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/user_module.html) module, to manage user accounts.

2- ["ansible.builtin.apt" ](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_module.html) module, to install and uninstall Nginx.

3- ["ansible.builtin.service" ](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/service_module.html) module, to start and enable Nginx services.

You can find builtin modules [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/index.html).


## Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/raeis-i/Ansible-Lab-With-Examples.git
$ cd Ansible_Lab_With_Examples
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh node1
$ vagrant@node1:~$ bash ansible.sh
$ vagrant@node1:~$ cd ansible/
```
## Encrypt variables and create user in all nodes
```bash
vagrant@node1:~/ansible$ ansible-vault encrypt playbooks/user_vars.yml 
New Vault password: 
Confirm New Vault password:
Encryption successful
vagrant@node1:~/ansible$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/create_user.yml --ask-vault-pass
Vault password:

```
## Remove user in nodes 1 and 2
You can also run the playbook for specific hosts or groups directly from the command line using the -l (limit) option.

By directly passing the username as an extra variable (-e "username=newuser"), Ansible will use this value during playbook execution.
```bash
vagrant@node1:~/ansible$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/remove_user.yml -l node1,node2 -e "username=newuser"

You can install,uninstall Nginx via below commands, try to install Nginx in all servers and check it.
```bash
vagrant@node1:~/ansible$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/install_nginx.yml
vagrant@node1:~/ansible$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/uninstall_nginx.yml
```

## Introduction to each file
1-Vagrantfile : 
Configurations related to the VM are stored in this file, you can change CPU and Ram.

2-bootstrap.sh : Change SSH config in all nodes and Add all nodes to hosts file in all servers.

3-vars.rb : You can use image name or download it, and define the number of total nodes and Network range.

4- ansible.sh : This file will copy only to node1 as an Ansible node to manage other nodes. This file will install Ansible, generate SSH key ,copy Key to all nodes, and create an inventory file.

5-./ansible/playbooks/user_vars.yml :
```bash
username: "newuser" #Define the username of the user to be created.
user_password: "newuser" #Define password
```

6-./ansible/playbooks/create_user.yml
```bash
